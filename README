This package contains Dorai Sitaram's slatex.  Unlike prior versions of this
package, it contains only the 'translated' --- that is, the racket-specific
--- version of slatex.  This means that an update to slatex can only be incorporated
into the Racket world by manually running scmxlate and placing the resulting
file into this collection.

Instructions for updating to a new version of SLaTeX (for the maintainer of this
collection):

1) Follow Dorai's instructions for generating the file 'slatex.scm' (currently,
this involves downloading the 'scmxlate' and 'slatex' packages and loading
the scmxlate.scm file while (current-directory) points to the slatex
directory.

2) place this file in (collection-path "slatex" "private")
3) also copy slatex.sty to (collection-path "slatex")

4) (hopefully temporary?) Modify slatex.scm so that it doesn't refer to
   slatex::slatex-error at evaluation time.

5) check it in.
